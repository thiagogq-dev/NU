In affected versions the File Drop features (\"Upload Only\" public link shares in Nextcloud) can be bypassed using the Nextcloud Richdocuments app. An attacker was able to read arbitrary files in such a share. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Richdocuments is upgraded to 3.8.4 or 4.2.1. If upgrading is not possible then it is recommended to disable the Richdocuments application.",

The Nextcloud Richdocuments application prior to versions 3.8.6 and 4.2.3 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files.

It is recommended that the Richdocuments application is upgraded to 3.8.6 or 4.2.3. As a workaround, disable the Richdocuments application in the app settings.",

In affected versions the secure view feature of the rich documents app can be bypassed by using unprotected internal API endpoint of the rich documents app. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Office app (richdocuments) is upgraded to 8.0.0-beta.1, 7.0.2 or 6.3.2. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the issue by taking steps to restrict the ability to download documents. This includes ensuring that the `WOPI configuration` is configured to only serve documents between Nextcloud and Collabora. It is highly recommended to define the list of Collabora server IPs as the allow list within the Office admin settings of Nextcloud.",
