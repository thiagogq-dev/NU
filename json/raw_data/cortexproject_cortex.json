        "Description": "The Alertmanager in CNCF Cortex before 1.8.1 has a local file disclosure vulnerability when -experimental.alertmanager.enable-api is used. The HTTP basic auth password_file can be used as an attack vector to send any file content via a webhook. The alertmanager templates can be used as an attack vector to send any file content because the alertmanager can load any text file specified in the templates list.",

        "Problem_Type": "CWE-22",
        "Description": "An issue was discovered in Grafana Cortex through 1.9.0. The header value X-Scope-OrgID is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to conduct directory traversal such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname, then Cortex will attempt to parse a rules file at that location and include some of the contents in the error message. (Other Cortex API requests can also be sent a malicious OrgID header, e.g., tricking the ingester into writing metrics to a different location, but the effect is nuisance rather than information disclosure.)",
