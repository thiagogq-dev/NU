        "Description": "Openapi generator is a java tool which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. openapi-generator-online creates insecure temporary folders with File.createTempFile during the code generation process. The insecure temporary folders store the auto-generated files which can be read and appended to by any users on the system. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.",
