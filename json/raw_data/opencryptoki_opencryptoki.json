        "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-Other",
        "Description": "A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve attack.",
