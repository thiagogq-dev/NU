This can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a directory traversal to bigbluebutton.properties. NOTE: this issue exists because of an ineffective mitigation to CVE-2020-12112 in which there was an attempted fix within an NGINX configuration file, without considering that the relevant part of NGINX is case-insensitive.",

An update to the `followRedirect` method in the `PresentationUrlDownloadService` has been made to validate all URLs to be used for presentation download. Two new properties `presentationDownloadSupportedProtocols` and `presentationDownloadBlockedHosts` have also been added to `bigbluebutton.properties` to allow administrators to define what protocols a URL must use and to explicitly define hosts that a presentation cannot be downloaded from. All URLs passed to `insertDocument` must conform to the requirements of the two previously mentioned properties. Additionally, these URLs must resolve to valid addresses, and these addresses must not be local or loopback addresses. There are no workarounds. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of BigBlueButton.",
