        "Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.",

        "Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. It allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated to software between the attacker client and Squid. There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers. The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace between a header name and a colon.",

Due to incorrect data management, it is vulnerable to information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication. Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target for remote code execution attacks.",
