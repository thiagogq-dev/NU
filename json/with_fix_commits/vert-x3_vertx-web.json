        "Problem_Type": "CWE-352",
        "Description": "Vert.x-Web framework v4.0 milestone 1-4 does not perform a correct CSRF verification. Instead of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF token in the cookie, it compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token that is stored in the session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF token in the request because the framework does not consider it. The cookies are automatically sent by the browser and the verification will always succeed, leading to a successful CSRF attack.",
