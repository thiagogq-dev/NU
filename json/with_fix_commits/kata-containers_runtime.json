        "Description": "An improper link resolution vulnerability affects Kata Containers versions prior to 1.11.0. Upon container teardown, a malicious guest can trick the kata-runtime into unmounting any mount point on the host and all mount points underneath it, potentiality resulting in a host DoS.",

        "Description": "Kata Containers before 1.11.0 on Cloud Hypervisor persists guest filesystem changes to the underlying image file on the host. A malicious guest can overwrite the image file to gain control of all subsequent guest VMs. Since Kata Containers uses the same VM image file with all VMMs, this issue may also affect QEMU and Firecracker based guests.",
