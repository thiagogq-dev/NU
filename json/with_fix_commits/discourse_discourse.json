        "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, attackers are able to bypass Discourse's server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection for private IPv4 addresses by using a IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. The issue is patched in the latest beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.",

        "Description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, some user provided URLs were being passed to FastImage without SSRF protection. Insufficient protections could enable attackers to trigger outbound network connections from the Discourse server to private IP addresses. This affects any site running the `tests-passed` or `beta` branches versions 3.1.0.beta2 and prior. This issue is patched in version 3.1.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches.
