        "Problem_Type": "CWE-327",
        "Description": "SimpleXMQ before 3.4.0, as used in SimpleX Chat before 4.2, does not apply a key derivation function to intended data, which can interfere with forward secrecy and can have other impacts if there is a compromise of a single private key. This occurs in the X3DH key exchange for the double ratchet protocol.",
