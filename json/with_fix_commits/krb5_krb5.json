        "Description": "plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.15.2 mishandles Distinguished Name (DN) fields, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) in situations involving untrusted X.509 data, related to the get_matching_data and X509_NAME_oneline_ex functions. NOTE: this has security relevance only in use cases outside of the MIT Kerberos distribution, e.g., the use of get_matching_data in KDC certauth plugin code that is specific to Red Hat.",

        "Description": "An authentication bypass flaw was found in the way krb5's certauth interface before 1.16.1 handled the validation of client certificates. A remote attacker able to communicate with the KDC could potentially use this flaw to impersonate arbitrary principals under rare and erroneous circumstances.",
