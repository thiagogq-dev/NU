        "Description": "Gradle versions from 1.4 to 5.3.1 use an insecure HTTP URL to download dependencies when the built-in JavaScript or CoffeeScript Gradle plugins are used. Dependency artifacts could have been maliciously compromised by a MITM attack against the ajax.googleapis.com web site.",

        "Description": "The HTTP client in Gradle before 5.6 sends authentication credentials originally destined for the configured host. If that host returns a 30x redirect, Gradle also sends those credentials to all subsequent hosts that the request redirects to. This is similar to CVE-2018-1000007.",

        "Description": "The PGP signing plugin in Gradle before 6.0 relies on the SHA-1 algorithm, which might allow an attacker to replace an artifact with a different one that has the same SHA-1 message digest, a related issue to CVE-2005-4900.",

        "Description": "In Gradle before version 7.0, on Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. Gradle builds could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. This vulnerability impacted builds using precompiled script plugins written in Kotlin DSL and tests for Gradle plugins written using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you are on Windows or modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on a Unix-like operating system with the \"sticky\" bit set on your system temporary directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. As a workaround, on Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the \"sticky\" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. If you are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only. For additional details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.",
