This could redirect a victim to an attacker controller place to steal Swagger authorization credentials or create a phishing page to steal other information. The issue has been fixed with the 2022-09 mailcow Mootember Update. As a workaround, one may delete the Swapper API Documentation from their e-mail server.",
