[{"repo_name": "MariaDB/server", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-31623", "Problem_Type": "CWE-667", "Description": "MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.", "URL": "https://github.com/MariaDB/server/pull/1938", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "7c30bc38a588b22b01f11130cfe99e7f36accf94", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}]
