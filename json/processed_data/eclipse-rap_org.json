[{"repo_name": "eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-4760", "Problem_Type": "CWE-22", "Description": "In Eclipse RAP versions from 3.0.0 up to and including 3.25.0, Remote Code Execution is possible on Windows when using the FileUpload component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for this is a not completely secure extraction of the file name in the FileUploadProcessor.stripFileName(String name) method. As soon as this finds a / in the path, everything before it is removed, but potentially \\ (backslashes) coming further back are kept.\n\nFor example, a file name such as /..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war can be used to upload a file to a Tomcat server under Windows, which is then saved as ..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war in its webapps directory and can then be executed.\n\n\n", "URL": "https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/pull/141", "Tag": "['Issue Tracking', 'Patch']", "fix_commit_hash": "221bb60a5833026d520541292977bcd5c4aa219f", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["5c9baadf6a211a8604ae9bdb1c6dce9b55fd5330"]}]
