The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve attack.", "URL": "https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/pull/402", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "4e3b43c3d8844402c04a66b55c6c940f965109f0", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}]
