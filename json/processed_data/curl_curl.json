[{"repo_name": "curl/curl", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2018-1000005", "Problem_Type": "CWE-125", "Description": "libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.", "URL": "https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231", "Tag": "['Issue Tracking', 'Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "fa3dbb9a147488a2943bda809c66fc497efe06cb", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["15cb03ad846a10c4aa4889d46804389ad11cdc1d"]}]
