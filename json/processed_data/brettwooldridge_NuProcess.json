[{"repo_name": "brettwooldridge/NuProcess", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-39243", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-Other", "Description": "NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java. In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.", "URL": "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/pull/143", "Tag": "['Exploit', 'Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "29bc09de561bf00ff9bf77123756363a9709f868", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}]
