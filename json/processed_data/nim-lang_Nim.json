[{"repo_name": "nim-lang/Nim", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21374", "Problem_Type": "CWE-295", "Description": "Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS without full verification of the SSL/TLS certificate due to the default setting of httpClient. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.", "URL": "https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/16940", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "abac35e7437dd1ac2b3687dfa51de7f9d4b6e853", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["297c8e403d110dd872e070563328f4e0c734cd01"]}, {"repo_name": "nim-lang/Nim", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-46872", "Problem_Type": "CWE-79", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Nim before 1.6.2.
