[{"repo_name": "pires/go-proxyproto", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-23351", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo", "Description": "The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.", "URL": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/71", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}, {"repo_name": "pires/go-proxyproto", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-23409", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo", "Description": "The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.6.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via creating connections without the proxy protocol header.", "URL": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/74/commits/cdc63867da24fc609b727231f682670d0d1cd346", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "cdc63867da24fc609b727231f682670d0d1cd346", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["26a1d2a6885ac695962d06a25ed5bb231f45f0ef"]}, {"repo_name": "pires/go-proxyproto", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-23409", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo", "Description": "The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.6.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) via creating connections without the proxy protocol header.", "URL": "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/74", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "3aa7ea95a821cf534fae576651e2ca11f222a4e3", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}]
