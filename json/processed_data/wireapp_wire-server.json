[{"repo_name": "wireapp/wire-server", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-22737", "Problem_Type": "CWE-280", "Description": "wire-server provides back end services for Wire, a team communication and collaboration platform. Prior to version 2022-12-09, every member of a Conversation can remove a Bot from a Conversation due to a missing permissions check. Only Conversation admins should be able to remove Bots. Regular Conversations are not allowed to do so. The issue is fixed in wire-server 2022-12-09 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-12-09/Chart 4.29.0, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds.", "URL": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/2870", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "74f86a6b75737878c4fb0bd03a80f75438d47d85", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["c829a7d3e5224371097e70b51e33a99ff17ee045"]}]
