[{"repo_name": "oamg/convert2rhel", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-0852", "Problem_Type": "CWE-359", "Description": "There is a flaw in convert2rhel. convert2rhel passes the Red Hat account password to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the password via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the privileges of the Red Hat account in question, but it could affect the integrity, availability, and/or data confidentiality of other systems that are administered by that account. This occurs regardless of how the password is supplied to convert2rhel.", "URL": "https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/pull/492", "Tag": "['Exploit', 'Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "8d72fb030ed31116fdb256b327d299337b000af4", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["154ac63520c66717515723aeb348d35eea968ce4"]}]
