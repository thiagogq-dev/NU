Starting in version 4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting.

Integrators can work around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.", "URL": "https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12760", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "980f48a9089849adda1d5035eb3ac5ba567a3b23", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["570c5d75bd172fbb2f6f68685326d4acb3978482"]}]
