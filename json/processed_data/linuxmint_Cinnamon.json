[{"repo_name": "linuxmint/Cinnamon", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2018-13054", "Problem_Type": "CWE-59", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cinnamon 1.9.2 through 3.8.6. The cinnamon-settings-users.py GUI runs as root and allows configuration of (for example) other users' icon files in _on_face_browse_menuitem_activated and _on_face_menuitem_activated. These icon files are written to the respective user's $HOME/.face location. If an unprivileged user prepares a symlink pointing to an arbitrary location, then this location will be overwritten with the icon content.", "URL": "https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/pull/7683", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "66e54f43f179fdf041a3e5232178a9910963cfb5", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["435e7a272b2ac6d7fa32dc219293408df5137c70"]}]
