An attacker could pass in memory objects larger than the buffer and wrap around to have a smaller buffer than required, allowing the attacker access to the other parts of the heap. We recommend upgrading the Google Cloud IoT Device SDK for Embedded C used to 1.0.3 or greater.", "URL": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/iot-device-sdk-embedded-c/pull/119", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "96018ab742975e1a4fc45857bb16140e52297041", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["87526f0080487e0f7f41d65cdb7710ba268055ac"]}]
