[{"repo_name": "jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-39224", "Problem_Type": "CWE-78", "Description": "Arr-pm is an RPM reader/writer library written in Ruby. Versions prior to 0.0.12 are subject to OS command injection resulting in shell execution if the RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field. This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class of this library. Version 0.0.12 patches these issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can be checked by using the rpm command line tool.", "URL": "https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/15", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "efddd459916ece7acf2cc5e34fd49131e7e7d6e5", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}, {"repo_name": "jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-39224", "Problem_Type": "CWE-78", "Description": "Arr-pm is an RPM reader/writer library written in Ruby.
