[{"repo_name": "pyinstaller/pyinstaller", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-49797", "Problem_Type": "CWE-732", "Description": "PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "URL": "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/7827", "Tag": "['Issue Tracking', 'Patch']", "fix_commit_hash": "5a53dc58295b26eb8af1f146df990a657bc916d1", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["45faec8b2fdfa5877498a2ef74d9e2fe93a3b423"]}]
