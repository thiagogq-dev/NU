[{"repo_name": "kartverket/github-workflows", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-39326", "Problem_Type": "CWE-94", "Description": "kartverket/github-workflows are shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions. Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build.", "URL": "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/pull/19", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "dbc2fc32d409ff0499d590b38b2690eb215fa354", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["1d97920dca1b01cdece1d466106177b754f9f9f0"]}]
