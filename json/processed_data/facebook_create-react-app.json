[{"repo_name": "facebook/create-react-app", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-24033", "Problem_Type": "CWE-78", "Description": "react-dev-utils prior to v11.0.4 exposes a function, getProcessForPort, where an input argument is concatenated into a command string to be executed. This function is typically used from react-scripts (in Create React App projects), where the usage is safe. Only when this function is manually invoked with user-provided values (ie: by custom code) is there the potential for command injection. If you're consuming it from react-scripts then this issue does not affect you.", "URL": "https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/10644", "Tag": "['Exploit', 'Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "f5e415f3a5b66f07dcc60aba1b445fa7cda97268", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["be43292445bd6b25ac825586c19fd300d5ea2955"]}]
