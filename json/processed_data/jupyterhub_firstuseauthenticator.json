[{"repo_name": "jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-41194", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo", "Description": "FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.", "URL": "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "d36ac9707f0c341b4906545477689d4fa7715a6c", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}, {"repo_name": "jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-41194", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo", "Description": "FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub.
