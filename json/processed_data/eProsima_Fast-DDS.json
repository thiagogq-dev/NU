[{"repo_name": "eProsima/Fast-DDS", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-42459", "Problem_Type": "CWE-415", "Description": "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "URL": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/pull/3824", "Tag": "['Patch']", "fix_commit_hash": "47fe5d7636769706fcf71bf7d183c34c64837e37", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["f9d722f13fbddaeaf3d4b94acfb6ba2c179318a1"]}]
