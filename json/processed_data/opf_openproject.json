In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.", "URL": "https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9447.patch", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "8365f575cb5626153aabbd73e55358987e353d52", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["29b3614bcb759214bb1aba77c27ac11c8ef6b15b"]}, {"repo_name": "opf/openproject", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-43830", "Problem_Type": "CWE-89", "Description": "OpenProject is a web-based project management software.

Starting with version 7.4.0 and prior to version 12.5.4, when a user registers and confirms their first two-factor authentication (2FA) device for an account, existing logged in sessions for that user account are not terminated. Likewise, if an administrators creates a mobile phone 2FA device on behalf of a user, their existing sessions are not terminated. The issue has been resolved in OpenProject version 12.5.4 by actively terminating sessions of user accounts having registered and confirmed a 2FA device. As a workaround, users who register the first 2FA device on their account can manually log out to terminate all other active sessions.
