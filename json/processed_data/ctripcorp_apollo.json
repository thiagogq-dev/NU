[{"repo_name": "ctripcorp/apollo", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-15170", "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-Other", "Description": "apollo-adminservice before version 1.7.1 does not implement access controls. If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.", "URL": "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "6ff6ddd47f9be87ad77a6a169cc46996cc5d89dd", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["04c94da1997f3d1500ee3b4b57602f91687b70f7"]}]
