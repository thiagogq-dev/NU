[{"repo_name": "go-resty/resty", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2023-45286", "Problem_Type": "CWE-362", "Description": "A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body disclosure across requests. This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request body.", "URL": "https://github.com/go-resty/resty/pull/745", "Tag": "['Issue Tracking', 'Patch']", "fix_commit_hash": "577fed8730d79f583eb48dfc81674164e1fc471e", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": ["4604150f0fe9f3cdab26779f0c056d9aff1107ab"]}]
