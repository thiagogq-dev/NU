[{"repo_name": "reportportal/service-api", "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-29620", "Problem_Type": "CWE-611", "Description": "Report portal is an open source reporting and analysis framework. Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release.", "URL": "https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1392", "Tag": "['Patch', 'Third Party Advisory']", "fix_commit_hash": "a73e0dfb4eda844c37139df1f9847013d55f084e", "inducing_commit_hash_pyszz": []}]
