        "Description": "The rad_packet_recv function in opt/src/accel-pppd/radius/packet.c suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability, whereby user input len is copied into a fixed buffer &attr->val.integer without any bound checks. If the client connects to the server and sends a large radius packet, a buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered.",

        "Description": "The rad_packet_recv function in radius/packet.c suffers from a memcpy buffer overflow, resulting in an overly-large recvfrom into a fixed buffer that causes a buffer overflow and overwrites arbitrary memory. If the server connects with a malicious client, crafted client requests can remotely trigger this vulnerability.",
