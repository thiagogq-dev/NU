        "Problem_Type": "CWE-834",
        "Description": "In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that the built-in support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has a number of edge cases where the input text of a number can lead to much larger processing time than one would expect.\n\n\nTo mitigate the risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the numbers as well as their scale.\n\n\n",
