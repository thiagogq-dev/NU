        "Problem_Type": "NVD-CWE-noinfo",
        "Description": "In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.",
