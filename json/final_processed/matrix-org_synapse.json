A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).",

This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by the user, although limited modification of request bodies was possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions.

Outbound requests to federation, identity servers, when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events, sending push notifications, and generating URL previews are affected. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure on dual-stack networks. See referenced GitHub security advisory for details and workarounds.",

        "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix specification specifies a list of [event authorization rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/rooms/v9/#authorization-rules) which must be checked when determining if an event should be accepted into a room. In versions of Synapse up to and including version 1.61.0, some of these rules are not correctly applied. An attacker could craft events which would be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server, potentially causing divergence in the room state between servers. Administrators of homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to version 1.62.0 or higher. Federation can be disabled by setting [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist) to an empty list (`[]`) as a workaround.",

        "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix specification specifies a list of [event authorization rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/rooms/v9/#authorization-rules) which must be checked when determining if an event should be accepted into a room. In versions of Synapse up to and including version 1.61.0, some of these rules are not correctly applied. An attacker could craft events which would be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server, potentially causing divergence in the room state between servers. Administrators of homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to version 1.62.0 or higher. Federation can be disabled by setting [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist) to an empty list (`[]`) as a workaround.",

However, in versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query for authorization events does not sufficiently check that the requesting server should be able to access them.

        "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities\u00c2\u2014it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process\u00c2\u2014it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL event can impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to a persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed federation (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server administrators are advised to upgrade to Synapse 1.94.0 or later.
