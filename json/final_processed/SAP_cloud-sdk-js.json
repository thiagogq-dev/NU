This affects applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that use the SAP Cloud SDK and enabled caching of destinations. In affected versions and in some cases, when user information was missing, destinations were cached without user information, allowing other users to retrieve the same destination with its permissions. By default, destination caching is disabled. The security for caching has been increased. The changes are released in version 1.52.0. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable destination caching (it is disabled by default).",
