        "Description": "The Denosaurs emoji package provides emojis for dinosaurs. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.3.0, the reTrimSpace regex has 2nd degree polynomial inefficiency, leading to a delayed response given a big payload. The issue has been patched in 0.3.0. As a workaround, avoid using the `replace`, `unemojify`, or `strip` functions.",
